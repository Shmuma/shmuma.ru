#title Сохранение в маппере расширенного GPX

All modifications live in [[http://github.com/Shmuma/maemo-mapper-shmuma/tree/gpx-full][gpx-full]] branch.

* Core functionality

Implemented in gpx-full.{c,h}, which export three routines:
  - =gpx_full_initialize= -- opens new file according to template and
    given path (it always creates fresh file) and writes header to it.
  - =gpx_full_append= -- appends new data portion from gps, including
    lat/lon, altitude, time, hdop, pdop, vdop and satellites
    used. Every ten data points it writes finalization tags and
    flushes file to prevent data corruption. It adjust file position
    to overwrite these closing tags when next data will come.
  - =gpx_full_finalize= -- writes finalization tags and closes file.
