#title Project ideas

Here is unstructured list of different projects which (maybe) worth to deal with.

* Someday/Maybe
  - patch [[kernel-crash-tool][crash]] utility for latest kernels (at the moment, version 4.0-8.9 fails to find entry on
    2.6.29 and later kernels).
  - make [[kernel-crash-tool][crash]] utility to understand ARM CPU (just for fun).
